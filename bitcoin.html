          <h3 class="section-heading">What is Bitcoin?</h3>
          <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency, and can also be used in many other ways. A Bitcoin can be divided into sub units. A millibitcoin - One Thousandth of a Bitcoin and a satoshi - One Hundred Millionth of a Bitcoin. There will only ever be Twenty One Million Bitcoin created and available to mine. This is written into the code and can never be changed or altered. It is this cap which gives Bitcoin its scarcity and value.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto  January 2009. This person or persons released the White Paper "Bitcoin , A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" to the world.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? </h2>

          <p> Satoshi Nakamoto is  anonymous and this has been one of the most important points for Bitcoin. As Bitcoin has no CEO no Manager no one person to make the decisions. It is an open source data base (a store of information) Known as a distributed ledger called a blockchain. Once a transaction is made on the blockchain. It can never be reversed, changed, altered or deleted. That transaction is there as long as the blockchain exists. </p> 


          <p>One of the most attractive features of Blockchain is that you as an individual can easily and securely invest in Tomorrow. We speak from our own experiences and mistakes when we say this. Back in 2015 we first learned about this new Technology called Blockchain and its goals. We quickly realized just from the people involved that this was no fad. We took the time to learn more about Blockchain and its implication on the world, In doing so we discovered that the institutions and even governments involved in the background where serious about this new and amazing Technology.
            That is why we started holding and investing are own wealth through these Blockchain systems.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Blockchain? </h2>

          <p>A blockchain is made up of a network of nodes running simultaneously across the globe. Transactions are verified by network nodes trough cryptography and recorded on the blockchain. </p>      
         
          
          
          
          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
