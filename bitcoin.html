          <h3 class="section-heading">What is Bitcoin?</h3>
          <p>Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency, and can also be used in many other ways. A Bitcoin can be divided into sub units. A millibitcoin - One Thousandth of a Bitcoin and a satoshi - One Hundred Millionth of a Bitcoin. There will only ever be Twenty One Million Bitcoin created and available to mine. This is written into the code and can never be changed or altered. It is this cap which gives Bitcoin its scarcity and value.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto  January 2009. This person or persons released the White Paper "Bitcoin , A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" to the world.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? </h2>

          <p> Satoshi Nakamoto is  anonymous and this has been one of the most important points for Bitcoin. As Bitcoin has no CEO no Manager no one person to make the decisions. It is an open source data base (a store of information) Known as a distributed ledger called a blockchain. Once a transaction is made on the blockchain. It can never be reversed, changed, altered or deleted. That transaction is there as long as the blockchain exists. </p> 


          <p>One of the most attractive features of Blockchain is that you as an individual can easily and securely invest in Tomorrow. We speak from our own experiences and mistakes when we say this. Back in 2015 we first learned about this new Technology called Blockchain and its goals. We quickly realized just from the people involved that this was no fad. We took the time to learn more about Blockchain and its implication on the world, In doing so we discovered that the institutions and even governments involved in the background where serious about this new and amazing Technology.
            That is why we started holding and investing are own wealth through these Blockchain systems.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Blockchain? </h2>

          <p>A blockchain is made up of a network of nodes running simultaneously across the globe. Transactions are verified by network nodes trough cryptography and recorded on the blockchain. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What are Nodes? </h2>
          
          <p>A node can be thought of as like an internet hub, a point where all the traffic (data) is routed through. The nodes which run on the Bitcoin network are spread all over the world, anyone with an internet connection can run a node. Bitcoins are created as a reward for this process, which is given the term Mining. </p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">What is Mining? </h2>
          
          <p>open source. For those who do know, and do run nodes are called miners. Miners are spread out across the world this makes the Blockchain decentralized. No Head Office no high street shop no one place. Which is another important point to remember.

             Once a miner has been rewarded a Bitcoin they can kTo mine for Bitcoin you must run a node, Which anyone can do if you know how because Bitcoin is eep hold of it or send it to anyone in the world with an internet connection and a Bitcoin wallet in which to receive it.(you don't need to run a node to have a Bitcoin Wallet) The receiver then can repeat this process and so on.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">What is a Wallet?</h2>
          
          <p>A wallet is your account, a place in which you can hold, send and receive Bitcoin. Having your own wallet is important and each wallet has what is known as a private key and a public key.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Private Keys?</h2>
          
          <p>Understanding private keys can be a hard task even for well educated people. The most simplest way to think of them are to think of the private key as a password that allows you to open your wallet. Your private key is paired with your public keys which sets off algorithms allowing a transaction to take place. If these two do not match then no transactions can be made. It is very important that you keep your private keys safe and to yourself. You will come to understand more on this as you get started.(NEVER SEND ANYONE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS)</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Public Keys?</h2>
          
          <p>Your public keys are like an email address or bank account number that is linked to your wallet. To receive Bitcoin from another person you must send them your public key( also known as your Address), to send Bitcoin you will send it to that persons public address.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">What is Bitcoin used for?</h2>
          
          <p>Bitcoin is used as a store of value which it gets from its scarcity and because it is decentralized. Think of it like digital Gold, only difference being you can send Bitcoin across the world in seconds to anyone with an internet connection. For the first time in modern history there is a store of value available to everyone regardless of your background, giving you the option to be your own bank. Get started and become an early adopter in this new amazing technology for our ever growing world.</p>
